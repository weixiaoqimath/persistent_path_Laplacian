# Persistent Path Laplacian

A naive python implementation of persistent path Laplacian (https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/fods.2022015). 
It's more suitable for pedagogical use. To imporove the algorithm, one may think about how to find orthonormal bases of Omega spaces while not messing up the order of paths.
