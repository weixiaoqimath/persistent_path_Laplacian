# Persistent Path Laplacian

A naive python implementation of persistent path Laplacian proposed by Rui Wang and Guo-Wei Wei. 
It's more suitable for pedagogical use. To imporove the algorithm, one may think about how to find orthonormal bases of Omega spaces while not messing up the order of paths.
